  The General Large Area Model for annual crops (GLAM; Challinor et al., 2004) was used to run crop simulations. Simulations were conducted for a historical period around the year 2000 (1990 to 2010), out to a future period centred on 2050 (2040-2060) and beyond to the 2080s. Planting windows and crop varieties were selected based on the combination that returned the highest yield in each year (using a rolling 21-year average). Different crop varieties were defined using different maturity classes.<br><br>

  The crops modelled in the four countries were maize, soybean, potato and groundnut. For full details of the simulations please see the iFEED methods paper (Jennings et al., in prep.). Outputs available to view include crop yields, planting dates, crop duration and LAI.<br><br>

  Simulations were conducted on a full range of yield gap and irrigation levels. The Yield Gap Parameter (YGP) was varied in increments of 0.1 to 1, with 1 corresponding to climatic potential yields. Values of YGP that resulted in closest mean yield levels to historical crop yields were:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>YGP = 0.1 for <b>maize and potato</b> in all countries, </li>

    <li>YGP = 0.6 for <b>soybean</b> in all countries apart from Zambia, where YGP = 0.7,</li>

    <li>YGP = 0.2 for <b>groundnut</b> in all countries apart from South Africa, where YGP = 0.3.</li>
</ul>

  Irrigation levels range from rainfed (parameter value of 0), and from 0.1 to 1, meaning different levels of irrigation up to full irrigation.<br><br>

  Simulations were conducted for RCP2.6 and 8.5 (to represent low and high climate risk) using data from Famien et al. (2018). CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation was accounted for by changing transpiration efficiency, radiation use efficiency and the maximum transpiration rate to simulate the responses seen in FACE data according to Kimball (2015).
